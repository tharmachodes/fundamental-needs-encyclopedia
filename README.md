# The Cosmic Classroom: A Collaborative Encyclopedia of Fundamental Needs

## Project Charter

Welcome to our collaborative encyclopedia! This repository is the digital home for our ongoing Montessori classroom project exploring the **Fundamental Needs of Humans** across cultures and time periods.

### Purpose

Inspired by the Great Lesson "The Coming of Humans," this project allows mixed-age groups of students to:
- Research how different cultures meet their fundamental needs
- Contribute well-researched, written articles to a shared knowledge base
- Learn about version control, collaboration, and digital publishing
- Practice academic writing, citation, and peer review

### Fundamental Needs Categories

Each culture entry should explore the following needs (adapted from Montessori materials):
1. **Shelter** – Architecture, housing, urban planning
2. **Food** – Agriculture, hunting, cooking, diet
3. **Clothing** – Textiles, garments, adornment
4. **Defense** – Military, fortifications, conflict resolution
5. **Transportation** – Roads, vehicles, trade routes
6. **Communication/Art** – Language, writing, music, visual arts
7. **Spiritual/Religious Expression** – Beliefs, rituals, sacred spaces
8. **Social Organization** – Government, laws, community structures

### How to Contribute

1. **Propose a Culture** – Open an Issue using the "New Culture Proposal" template.
2. **Create a Branch** – Work in an isolated branch named `feature/[culture-name]`.
3. **Research and Write** – Create a folder in `cultures/` with a `README.md` article.
4. **Submit for Review** – Open a Pull Request to merge your branch into `main`.
5. **Revise and Improve** – Respond to feedback from teachers and peers.
6. **Publish** – Once approved, your work will be merged into the encyclopedia!
