## Introduction

Ancient Sumer is one of the earliest civilizations in human history, located in the fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Known for inventing writing (cuneiform), building massive ziggurats, and developing complex irrigation systems, the Sumerians laid the foundations for many aspects of later societies.

## Fundamental Needs

### Shelter

The Sumerians built their houses from sun-dried mud bricks because stone and wood were scarce in Mesopotamia. Ordinary families lived in small rectangular houses with flat roofs, while the elite lived in larger compounds. The most famous Sumerian shelters were **ziggurats**—stepped temple towers dedicated to the gods. The ziggurat of Ur is a well-preserved example.

### Food

Sumerian agriculture relied on irrigation canals to bring water from the rivers to their fields. They grew barley, wheat, dates, onions, and garlic. They also raised sheep, goats, and cattle for meat, milk, and wool. Beer was a staple drink, brewed from barley. The rich ate more varied diets including fish, poultry, and imported goods, while the poor mostly ate bread and beer.

### Clothing

Most clothing was made from wool, though linen was also used. Men wore skirt-like garments called **kaunakes**, and women wore long dresses. Both sexes used jewelry such as necklaces, bracelets, and earrings made from gold, silver, and lapis lazuli. Hairstyles were elaborate, often with braids and hairpieces.

### Defense

Sumerian city-states like Ur, Uruk, and Lagash frequently fought each other over water rights and territory. Soldiers used bronze weapons, shields, and chariots. City walls made of mud bricks provided protection. The Epic of Gilgamesh mentions the building of Uruk’s walls.

### Transportation

The Sumerians used wheeled carts pulled by oxen for land transport. Boats made of reeds or wood traveled the rivers and canals, carrying goods and people. Trade routes extended to the Indus Valley, Anatolia, and Egypt, exchanging textiles, grain, and precious stones.

### Communication & Art

The Sumerians invented **cuneiform** writing, pressing wedge-shaped marks into clay tablets. They wrote laws, myths, letters, and business records. Literature includes the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, one of the oldest known stories. Art included cylinder seals, statues of worshippers, and elaborate pottery.

### Spiritual & Religious Expression

Sumerians worshipped many gods, each associated with a natural force or city. Temples were central to city life, and priests held great power. Rituals included sacrifices, music, and festivals. They believed in an afterlife in a gloomy underworld called *Kur*.

### Social Organization

Sumerian society was hierarchical: the king (lugal) and priests at the top, followed by scribes, merchants, farmers, and slaves. The **Code of Ur-Nammu** is one of the oldest known law codes, prescribing punishments for crimes. Family life was patriarchal, but women could own property and run businesses in some cases.

## Unique Contributions

- **Cuneiform writing** – first known writing system
- **The wheel** – used for pottery and transportation
- **Irrigation systems** – allowed large-scale agriculture in dry region
- **Mathematics** – base‑60 number system (still used for time and angles)
- **Ziggurats** – stepped pyramids that influenced later temple architecture

## Comparisons with Other Cultures

Unlike Egypt, which had a more centralized state and stone pyramids, Sumer consisted of independent city‑states with mud‑brick ziggurats. Their writing system evolved from pictographs to abstract cuneiform, whereas Egyptian hieroglyphs remained pictorial longer.

## Research Notes

We found it fascinating that the Sumerians invented so many things we still use today, like the wheel and writing. It was challenging to find reliable sources about everyday life of ordinary people. We enjoyed learning about ziggurats and cuneiform.
